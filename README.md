# Shell Setup

Scripts for easy shell backup/setup

## Usage

create a private Fork of this repository and clone it into your `$HOME` directory. Add the `bin/` folder to your path.

Create backups using `shell-backup`.

> Before the first backup you might move the dotfiles you want to backup into the folder `$HOME/shell_setup/dotfiles` and create a symbolic link in your `$HOME` directory

If you have an existing backup clone your repository into the `$HOME` of a new machine and run `shell-setup`
